## üë©‚Äçüíª Projects
### Clustering/Classifying Human vs. AI-Generated Images 
       ‚Ä¢	Processed 79K+ images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting for classification and clustering tasks  
       ‚Ä¢	Applied Sobel filtering, PCA, and GMM with majority voting for unsupervised clustering, achieving 77.28% accuracy  
       ‚Ä¢	Fine-tuned a ResNet-50 CNN model using PyTorch in Python, reaching 99.61% classification accuracy 
### An interactive visualization platform for California Wildfire 
       ‚Ä¢	Built an XGBoost model in Python with Bayesian tuning and SMOTE to predict wildfire risk, achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.98  
       ‚Ä¢	Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to showcase model outputs, highlight seasonal risk peaks and resources mismatches across the U.S. and California; received a 4.88/5 user study rating. 
 

### [**- Database Design and Implementation through MySQL**](https://github.com/stephaniee-ui/Database-design-and-implementation.git)
       ‚Ä¢	Designed and implemented an Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD) for a product delivery system, incorporating strong/weak entities, relationships, and constraints.  
       ‚Ä¢	Converted the EERD into a relational schema, creating CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements for data integrity and importing non-normalized data.  
       ‚Ä¢	Developed 21 stored procedures and 6 views to manage product deliveries and optimize system operations.  

### [**- Predicting Amazon Delivery Times through Multiple Linear Regression**](https://github.com/stephaniee-ui/Regression-Analysis.git)
       ‚Ä¢	Performed data cleaning, imputation, outlier detection, multicollinearity and applied multiple regression models including LASSO for feature selection.  
       ‚Ä¢	Identified relationships between delivery times and quantitative and qualitative variables through Python to improve operational efficiency.
