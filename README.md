### **- Database Design and Implementation through MySQL**

### **- Predicting Amazon Delivery Times through Multiple Linear Regression**    
       â€¢	Performed data cleaning, imputation, outlier detection, multicollinearity and applied multiple regression models including LASSO for feature selection.  
       â€¢	Identified relationships between delivery times and quantitative and qualitative variables through Python to improve operational efficiency.
